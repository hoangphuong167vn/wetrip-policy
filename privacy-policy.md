This data is handled securely through **Apple**, **Google**, and **RevenueCat**, and does not include personal identifiers such as your name or email.

### c. User-Generated Content
User-input data (e.g., trip expenses, friend lists) is processed locally on your device and not collected by us. All trip data remains on your device.
